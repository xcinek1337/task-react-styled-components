# React - Styled Components

![styling-readme](https://github.com/xcinek1337/task-react-styled-components/assets/125750465/8c87c564-78da-47e8-afac-6f2718a8838c)

This project presents an example form with frontend validation. In this task, I aimed to achieve a three-dimensional appearance for the form, utilizing the neumorphic style, which I believe adds attractiveness to web applications. 

For styling this project, I used the `styled-components` package, allowing me to practice working with this library by creating styled components.

## Features

- **Frontend Validation**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before submission.
- **Neumorphic Design**: Adds a three-dimensional, soft UI look to the form, enhancing its visual appeal.
- **Styled Components**: Demonstrates the use of `styled-components` for modular and maintainable CSS in JS.
-  **Confetti Effect**: Adds a confetti animation upon successful form submission, enhancing user experience with a confetti effect using the `react-dom-confetti` package.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Styled Components**: For styling and creating modular CSS.
- **react-confetti**: For adding the confetti effect upon form submission.

## What I Learned

- **Styled Components**: How to use the `styled-components` library for writing modular CSS.
- **Frontend Validation**: How to implement real-time form validation on the client side.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: How to add interactive and engaging effects like confetti.
